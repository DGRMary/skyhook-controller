# skyhook-controller
This is a project realised for the 'model based software design' course at Politecnico di Torino, implementing a skyhook control system using Matlab, Simulink, Stateflow and simulIDE

## About

This project is divided into two parts: - The first part required the implementation of a skyhook control system and a plant representing the quarter car model, using simulink and stateflow.  -In the second part, the code had to be generated automatically; among the auto-generated files was the binary file of the Arduino firmware. Once this file was obtained, the controller had to be tested on the Arduino (simulated with simulIDE).
